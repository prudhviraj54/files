amount submitted - the amount you were charged for a product or service. amount eligible - the portion of the amount submitted that is eligible for whole or partial reimbursement by your plan. percent paid (coinsurance) - the percentage of the amount eligible that your plan covers, sometimes referred to as coinsurance. for example, if your plan covers 80% of the amount eligible, then you will not be reimbursed for the other 20%. co-ordination of benefits if you have health or dental coverage under another plan, you can get up to 100% of your eligible expenses covered. industry-wide procedures -- determined by canadian life and health insurance association (clhia) guidelines -- establish which plan considers a claim first. through coordination of benefits, you can submit the unpaid part of a claim to the second plan for payment. for example, if this plan pays 80% of an expense, the other plan may pay the remaining 20%. here's how to take advantage of coordination of benefits for you send your claims to your plan first. then submit the claim statement -- along with copies of receipts -- for any unpaid portion to your spouse's plan. for your spouse send your spouse's claims to their plan first, then submit the claim statement -- along with copies of receipts -- for any unpaid portion to this plan. for your children . if you are the parent whose birthday (month and day)
